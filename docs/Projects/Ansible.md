This is one of the automation tools I developed to simplify the installation of essential resources on the ETP branch server. Using Ansible, it automates the entire setup process from dependency installation to repository configuration ensuring consistent, efficient deployment across production environments. By eliminating repetitive manual steps, this playbook enables faster, cleaner, and more reliable provisioning.
