I'm Angelo L. De Castro, an IT enthusiast with practical experience in network administration, system administration, and technical support.
Currently serving as a Data Center/System Administrator at Wilcon Depot Head Office, I specialize in managing multi-branch Linux and Windows deployments, optimizing virtual infrastructure, and ensuring system reliability across critical services. My work includes patching and maintaining ETP servers and POS systems, troubleshooting system errors, and monitoring performance using VMware vSphere ESXi.

Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging open-source technologies and automation to solve operational challenges and support scalable IT solutions. Iâ€™m actively developing skills in scripting, containerization with Docker Compose, and infrastructure automation using Ansible.

I thrive in fast-paced environments where collaboration and continuous learning drive innovation. Through hands-on experience and a commitment to technical excellence, Iâ€™m dedicated to mastering seamless deployment processes and contributing to teams that build resilient, future-ready systems.
